Data Science with Python - 2

1.	Did you learn anything of potential business value from this analysis?

The main conclusion out of the EDA I drew is that I can test 3 hypotheses to then infer based on the outcome obtained from the model(s) used:
a.	Credit default based on credit card owner’s gender (Male/Female). 
b.	Credit default based on credit card owner’s gender (Male/Female) and educational level. 
c.	Credit default based on credit card owner’s gender (Male/Female), educational level, and marital status. 

2.	What are the main lessons you've learned from this experience?

The main lessons I’ve learned were the once got me stuck the most time:
a.	Pandas-profiling took me several days to be able to install. After I used -c conda-forge  pandas-profiling, I finally saw the light at the end of the tunnel. 
b.	The data type for all columns was showing as “object”, I was not being able to convert some variables to “category” and “integer”, I finally discovered that after a proper cleaning of the data, I could remove this roadblock and start with the exploration of the data 
c.	Understanding the data is key to knowing what tools I will use to visualize the data. Not just because some tools are commonly used for data visualization, they will be a fit for the data I am working with. Knowing the data is key to address the problem properly and to find tools that really add value to my investigation.  

3.	What recommendations would you give to the Guido regarding your findings?

No recommendations at this point, I will test the hypotheses and present the results thrown to Guido Rossum from Credit One. I will give a heads up on any other findings that I may come across while working on my models; however, I will not deepen on those secondary findings as the pillars of my work are the three 3 hypotheses I will be formulating.
